1. **Where to Find Documentation**
*Where can you find the most complete Ruby documentation?*

https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/ or http://ruby-doc.org/

---

2. **while Loops**
*Locate the description of the `while` loop in the Ruby documentation.*

control expressions > `while` Loop

---

3. **Return Value of While**
*Using the Ruby documentation, determine what value a `while` loop returns.*

"The result of a `while` loop is `nil` unless `break` is used to supply a value."

---

4. **Return Value of While**
*In the previous exercise, you learned that the `while` loop returns `nil` unless `break` is used. Locate the documentation for `break`, and determine what value `break` sets the return value to for the `while` loop.*

The value returned by `break` is the result of the `break` expression

Solution: "`break` returns `nil` when no arguments are passed to `break`, or the value of the argument when an argument is provided."

5. **Large Numbers**
*Using the Ruby documentation, determine how you can write large numbers in a way that makes them easier to read.*

You can use an underscore in place of a comma. For example, 1_234 is the same as 1,234.

---

6. **Symbol Syntax**
*Using the Ruby documentation, determine how you would write a **Symbol** that represents your name. We aren't looking for a String; we want a Symbol, which is one of Ruby's datatypes.*

7. **String Class**
*Let's move on now to the documentation you will use most often: the core API section on Classes and Modules. All of these are listed under **Classes** on the Core API page.*
*Locate and open the class documentation for the `String` class.*

Classes > Classes and Modules > String

---

8. **Right Justifying Strings**
*Use the ruby documentation for the `String` class to determine which method can be used to right justify a `String` object.*
