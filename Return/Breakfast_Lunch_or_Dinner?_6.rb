# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

# def meal
#   return 'Breakfast'
#   'Dinner'
#   puts 'Dinner'
# end

# puts meal

# Breakfast

# because the first line returns 'Breakfast' so nothing else in the method will run but puts will print that return value
