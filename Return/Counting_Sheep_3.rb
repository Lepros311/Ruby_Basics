# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

# def count_sheep
#   5.times do |sheep|
#     puts sheep
#     if sheep >= 2
#       return
#     end
#   end
# end

# p count_sheep

# 0
# 1
# 2
# nil

# because it's only printing 0-2 until the if statement allows the return that returns nothing (nil)
