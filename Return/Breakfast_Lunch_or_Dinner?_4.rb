# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

# def meal
#   puts 'Dinner'
#   return 'Breakfast'
# end

# puts meal

# Dinner
# Breakfast

# because the method is printing 'Dinner' first and then puts is printing the return value of the method which is 'Breakfast'
