# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

# def count_sheep
#   5.times do |sheep|
#     puts sheep
#   end
#   10
# end

# puts count_sheep

# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 10

# because it's printing 0-4 per the times method, then it's printing the value returned by the last line of the method which is '10'
